## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I was able to pair up React and Tailwind together to create a powerful combination, which made this challenging project exciting and I learned a lot while building the web application. I was able to understand the features that hooks bring along with them as I created function-based components. I styled those components with Tailwind with reference to their documentation (which is a really helpful one). I was able to learn routing as well while building the application.

```
! Worth Mentioning !

The custom loader that [Loader.jsx].
The animation for the custom loader [tailwind.config.js]
```

### Continued development

One of the things I would like to do is to redirect to a different page when clicked on a border-country. Furthermore, I could improve some styles on the details page.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Concise and clear documentation about tailwind which is beginner-friendly whereas can be used by a professional as well. I really like it and will use it going forward.
- [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - To learn more about react.
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Looked for some object properties whild building the project.
